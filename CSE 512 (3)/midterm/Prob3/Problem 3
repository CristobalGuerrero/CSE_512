Problem 3: For the not self-organizing list with 5 values in the list there is 13 total comparisons. Now with the self-organizing link list there is 10 value comparisons for having 5 values. Both performances are accurate and cost efficient. The self-organizing link list is constantly checking for values as they are placed in the list. Though these two types of list organization depends on the type of work it is for. An example of this is with the vector stl is that there is a function that orders the vector in descending order or ascending order, therefore, though the self-organizing list is more efficient it depends on the situation for the type of data the list is holding.
